      <h2>We make films.</h2>

      <h2>How &amp; What.</h2>
      <p>WEâ€™VE SEEN THE FUTURE (of affordable HD film production) - it's pretty epic. We're using the latest HD (High Definition) DSLR (Digital SLR) technology and HD video equipment. This equipment is giving us the opportunity to produce content that we've always wanted to, it looks awesome and we want to show you!</p>
      <p>Our solid state cameras and Final Cut Studio editing suite help us maintain a fast and efficient workflow to deliver your films on time and in budget, without the need for dv tapes and annoying capture times.</p>
